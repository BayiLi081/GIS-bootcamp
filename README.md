# GIS Bootcamp for MUSPP students

Contributors: Li Bayi

## Preparation

In this bootcamp, QGIS will be used for several advantages:

- Open source
- Cross-Platform
- Integration with Python

Please make sure that you have properly installed the QGIS from the [official website](https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html) before the bootcamp started. You can download the LTR version as it is more stable to run on your computer and compatible to more extensions normally.
