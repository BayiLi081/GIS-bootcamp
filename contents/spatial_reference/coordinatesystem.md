# Spatial Reference: Coordinate reference systems

There are local, regional or global coordinate reference systems depending on the specific area.

It is important that you are working with the correct coordinate system.

## Geographic coordinate reference systems

unit: degree of latitude and longitude

## Projected coordinate reference systems

unit: metres

Every map projection introduces distortion, and each has its own set of problems. 

Even for the the most common projection, Mercator projection, receives huge criicism for exaggerating the size of countries nearer the poles. 

> On the Mercator projection Greenland appears to be roughly the same size as Africa. In reality, Greenland is 0.8 million sq. miles and Africa is 11.6 million sq. miles, nearly 14 and a half times larger.

## EPSG codes

EPSG is the unique ID linked to a specific coordinate reference system.
