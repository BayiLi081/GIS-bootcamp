# What is spatial analysis?

Spatial analysis investigates spatial pattern and process ([O'Sullivan & Unwin, 2003](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Geographic+Information+Analysis%2C+2nd+Edition-p-9780470288573)).

It always surrounds the following three questions?

- What is the pattern in space?
- What process created this pattern?
- Is the pattern always evident?

## Example of spatial analysis
