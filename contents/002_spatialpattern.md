# Spatial Pattern

Spatial analysis investigates spatial pattern and process ([O'Sullivan & Unwin, 2003](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Geographic+Information+Analysis%2C+2nd+Edition-p-9780470288573)).

- What is the spatial pattern?

  - Random?

    Spatial data **may** have pattern.

  - Trend?

    Spatial dependency

  - Clustered or dispersed?

    Spatial autocorrelation

- What process created this pattern?
- Is the pattern always evident?

## Addition: the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem (MAUP)

- **Scale effect**: Different results are obtained when the same set of data are grouped into areal units of different size.
- **Selection effect**: Different results are obtained when the shape or location of same-sized areal units is changed.

Select a system of areal units that minimise these effects based on the nature of the research.
